  "description": "The tapas tradition is the delightful Spanish custom of gathering at ‘Tascas’ (watering holes providing food) for a glass of sherry, wine or beer and sampling a range of different dishes amongst friends. Tapas is fun and informal. Here at Barceloneta we also provide racions (larger portion dishes), both in the menu and on our regularly changing Special Boards. As well as Spain, our food is influenced from other regions of the Mediterranean and of the wider Latin world. So, grab yourself a drink, order your dishes and away you go. (If you have never tried this style before don’t be afraid to ask us for some suggestions, on drinks as well as food.) \"Buen Apetito\"",
